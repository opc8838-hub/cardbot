# Third-Party Notices

CardBot may be used commercially. Commercial use does not remove the
obligations of the licenses below. The exact dependency versions are pinned
in `package-lock.json` and `whatsapp-plugin/package-lock.json`. The full
license texts included in this distribution are under `LICENSES/`.

## Communication and WhatsApp components

| Component | Version | Upstream | License | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `whatsapp-web.js` | 1.34.7 | [wwebjs/whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/wwebjs/whatsapp-web.js) | Apache-2.0 | Legacy CRM backend Web client and QR/session integration |
| `@whiskeysockets/baileys` | 7.0.0-rc13 | [WhiskeySockets/Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) | MIT | Communication Web protocol provider |
| `libsignal` | 6.0.0 | [WhiskeySockets/libsignal-node](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/libsignal-node) | GPL-3.0 | Signal protocol runtime used by Baileys |
| `node-webpmux` | 3.2.1 | [ApeironTsuka/node-webpmux](https://github.com/ApeironTsuka/node-webpmux) | LGPL-3.0-or-later | Transitive media dependency of `whatsapp-web.js` |

The Communication service was integrated from the local `CRM系统对接`
working copy. That working copy had no upstream commit or remote configured;
therefore its original application code is attributed to the CardBot project
contributors, while the protocol and crypto components above remain the
property of their upstream authors.

## Other dependencies

| Component | Version | Upstream | License | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `postal-mime` | 3.0.0 | [postalsys/postal-mime](https://github.com/postalsys/postal-mime) | MIT-0 | Parse local RFC822/EML history into traceable email evidence |

The v2 text-earth preview also uses `d3-geo`, `topojson-client`, and
`world-atlas`, under ISC licenses as declared by the installed packages.
Exact versions are recorded in the root lockfile. Their copyright and license
texts must remain with redistributed package/bundle copies. `d3-geo` also
includes a GeographicLib notice; retain its complete package LICENSE.
The background geography is generated from the installed world-atlas land
geometry; it is not copied from the user's reference screenshot.

The CRM and Communication applications also use React, Express, Vite,
PostgreSQL/MySQL clients, Socket.IO, Lucide, BullMQ and other packages. Their
copyright and license notices remain in the installed package trees and are
identified by the two lockfiles. Redistributing a built package must retain
the corresponding package license files and this notice.
